    		After the collapse of their army in the confrontation at Ludford Bridge, the Yorkist leaders fled from England. York took refuge in Ireland, while Edward went with the Nevilles to Calais, where Warwick was governor. In 1460 Edward landed in Kent with Salisbury, Warwick and Salisbury's brother William Neville, Lord Fauconberg, raised an army and occupied London.[9] Leaving Salisbury besieging the Tower of London, Edward, Warwick and Fauconberg advanced against the king, who was with an army in the Midlands, and defeated and captured him in the Battle of Northampton. Having returned to England, York was declared the king's heir, but Queen Margaret raised a fresh army against him, and he was killed at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, along with his younger son Edmund, Earl of Rutland and the Earl of Salisbury.[8]

This left Edward at the head of the Yorkist faction. Having defeated a Lancastrian army at Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire on 2–3 February 1461, he united his forces with those of Warwick, who had been defeated by Margaret's army at the Second Battle of St Albans, during which Henry VI had been rescued by his supporters.[9] Whereas his father had restricted his ambitions to becoming Henry's heir, Edward now took the more radical step of proclaiming himself king in March 1461.[9] He then advanced against the Lancastrians, and having his life saved on the battle field by the Welsh Knight Sir David Ap Mathew, defeated them in the exceptionally bloody Battle of Towton in Yorkshire on 29 March 1461.[10] Having effectively broken the military strength of the Lancastrians, Edward returned to London for his coronation. King Edward IV named Sir David Ap Mathew Standard Bearer of England and allowed him to use 'Towton' on the Mathew Family Crest.
