    	<h1>About Us</h1>
  
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        The idea for Fourth Axis History came from a simple AP European History assignment: "Illustrate the history of France and England using timelines". After completing the assignment, the realization hit us: why can't we see all of history like this? Our teachers always told us that history was about context. What cause the Revolutions of 1848? What were the long-term results of the Seven Years War? So why can't we present history visually?

        Our team came together after four years of participating together in the National History Day competition. After four straight trips to the New York State Competition and two trips to the National competition, we knew we couldn't stop working together.

        We want to take our love of history and share it with you. We want to give users the metaphorical Silk Road to not only see what was going on in Ancient Rome, but to see what was going on in Ancient China at the same time; we want you to leave our website with the same motivation to study history that inspired our team to compete in National History Day 4 times; and most importantly, we want each user to be exposed to large amounts of unique information in a consise and visually appealing way.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our goal is to allow users to engage with historical events and figures by providing them with a diverse set of interactive timelines. We believe that history is about more than facts; it's about context behind each event including what was going on in the wider world at the time.
